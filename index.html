  I am a McDuff endowed postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.slmath.org/">Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute</a> (SLMath).
  <br>
  <br>
  My research lies in the intersection of low-dimensional topology and dynamics. 
  <br>
  My interests include flows and foliations on 3-manifolds, homeomorphisms of surfaces, and related topics. 
  <br>
  You can find a list of my preprints and publications here.
  <br>
  <br>
  I received my PhD at UC Berkeley under the supervision of Ian Agol.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Fall 2026, I will be a distinguished researcher at <a href="https://math.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm">Tongji University</a>.
